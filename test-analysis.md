# Testing Framework Analysis: Cypress vs Playwright vs Puppeteer

## Current Issue Analysis

### Why Cypress is Struggling with Supabase Auth:

1. **Cookie/Session Handling**: Supabase uses httpOnly cookies and localStorage for auth tokens. Cypress has known issues with:
   - Cross-origin cookie handling
   - localStorage persistence between page loads
   - Session cookies in headed mode

2. **Async Auth Flow**: Supabase auth is heavily async with:
   - JWT token refresh
   - Cookie setting delays
   - Server-side session validation

3. **Next.js App Router + Supabase**: The combination creates complexity:
   - Server Components checking auth
   - Middleware redirects
   - Client-side hydration

## Framework Comparison for Your Needs:

### Cypress (Current)
**Pros:**
- Already set up and configured
- Good for component testing
- Nice UI for debugging

**Cons:**
- Struggles with modern auth flows
- Issues with cookies/localStorage
- Can't test multiple browser contexts
- Limited cross-origin support

### Playwright (Recommended) âœ…
**Pros:**
- **Superior Auth Handling**: Native support for auth states
- **Context Isolation**: Can save and reuse auth states
- **Better Cookie Management**: Handles httpOnly cookies properly
- **Multi-Browser Support**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Faster Execution**: Runs tests in parallel
- **Better Async Support**: Built for modern web apps
- **TypeScript First**: Better DX with your Next.js app
- **Trace Viewer**: Better debugging than Cypress

**Cons:**
- Need to set up from scratch
- Different API to learn

### Puppeteer
**Pros:**
- Direct Chrome control
- Good for web scraping

**Cons:**
- Chrome-only
- More low-level
- No built-in test runner
- Weaker test assertions

## Recommendation: Playwright

For your Supabase migration testing needs, **Playwright** is the best choice because:

1. **Auth State Management**: Playwright can save authenticated browser state and reuse it:
```typescript
// Save auth state once
await page.goto('/login');
await page.fill('[type="email"]', 'admin@test.com');
await page.fill('[type="password"]', 'password123');
await page.click('[type="submit"]');
await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');
// Save the auth state
await context.storageState({ path: 'auth.json' });

// Reuse in all tests
const context = await browser.newContext({
  storageState: 'auth.json'
});
```

2. **Handles Your Stack Better**:
- Next.js App Router
- Server Components
- Supabase Auth cookies
- Edge Functions
- Real-time subscriptions

3. **Better for Comprehensive Testing**:
- Can test different user roles in parallel
- Proper cookie/localStorage handling
- Network interception for Edge Functions
- WebSocket testing for real-time

4. **Migration Testing Specific Benefits**:
- Test both NextAuth and Supabase auth systems
- Compare behaviors side-by-side
- Handle redirects properly
- Test session persistence accurately

## Next Steps:

1. Install Playwright
2. Create auth setup fixtures
3. Convert critical tests
4. Run comprehensive migration tests
