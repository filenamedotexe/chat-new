# UI Improvement Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document contains step-by-step instructions for implementing practical UI/UX modernization across all features including the chat functionality. Focus on making things work properly and look modern without over-engineering. Total implementation consists of 8 phases with 24 specific chunks.

## Core Principles
1. **Function over form**: Make it work right before making it fancy
2. **Small chunks**: Each task should take 15-30 minutes max
3. **Test everything**: Manual test → Cypress test → Mark complete
4. **Modern but practical**: 2025 best practices without unnecessary complexity
5. **Update this doc**: Mark completed items and add learnings
6. **Zero headaches**: If stuck for >10 mins, reassess approach
7. **NO AUTO-COMMITS**: Never commit to git unless explicitly asked by the user
